# Spelling Corrector #

This is a simple app that essentially attempts to stop you making the same spelling mistakes over and over. It does
this, quite simply, by having you repeatedly type said words over and over, and turning red if you got it wrong.

While I intended this to be used for spelling mistakes, it probably could be used for other things that you need to type
over and over. Who knows?

It can run on your local computer (with no installation, just load index.html in your web browser), or a web server.
An online version is at [http://sc.app.savagewolf.org/] if you are so inclined.

Why is this open source? Why not!

# Usage #

To use it, first you will need to add words. Click the settings button and the settings menu should slide down.
Add words by typing them into the box and clicking "+" and remove them by clicking the "x". Quite simple.

You then type the (randomly chosen) word at the bottom of the second "block thing", into the text area above it.
If you typed it correctly, it will stay green, otherwise it will turn red when you start typing it wrong. Just backspace
and try again!
